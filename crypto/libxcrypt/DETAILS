cat << EOF
libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords. It supports a
wide variety of both modern and historical hashing methods: yescrypt, gost-
yescrypt, scrypt, bcrypt, sha512crypt, sha256crypt, md5crypt, SunMD5, sha1crypt,
NT, bsdicrypt, bigcrypt, and descrypt. It provides the traditional Unix crypt
and crypt_r interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by
Openwall Linux, crypt_rn, crypt_ra, crypt_gensalt, crypt_gensalt_rn, and
crypt_gensalt_ra.
