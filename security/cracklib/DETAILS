Cracklib is a library which may be used in a passwd-like program.
CrackLib is a library containing a C function (well, lots of functions really,
but you only need to use one of them) which may be used in a "passwd"-like
program.
The idea is simple: try to prevent users from choosing passwords that could be
guessed by "Crack" by filtering them out, at source.
CrackLib is an offshoot of the the version 5 "Crack" software, and contains a
considerable number of ideas nicked from the new software.
