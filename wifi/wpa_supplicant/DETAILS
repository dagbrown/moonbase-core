wpa_supplicant is a WPA Supplicant for Linux with support for WPA and WPA2 (IEEE
802.11i / RSN). Supplicant is the IEEE 802.1X/WPA component that is used in the
client stations. It implements key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and it
controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication/association of the wlan
driver.
wpa_supplicant is designed to be a "daemon" program that runs in the background
and acts as the backend component controlling the wireless connection.
wpa_supplicant supports separate frontend programs and an example text-based
frontend, wpa_cli, is included with wpa_supplicant.
