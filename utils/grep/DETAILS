grep - Finds lines that match entered patterns
Package includes the GNU 'grep', 'egrep', and 'fgrep', which find lines that
match entered patterns. By default, grep prints the matching lines.
GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about twice as
fast as the standard Unix grep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper search for
a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being considered by the full
regexp match without having to look at every chanracter; the result is usually
many times faster than UNIX 'grep' or 'egrep'.
