cat << EOF
This PSmisc package is a set of some small useful utilities that use the
proc filesystem. We're not about changing the world, but providing the
system administrator with some help in common tasks.
The package contains the following programs:
    * fuser   - identifies what processes are using files.
    * killall - kills a process by its name, similar to a pkill found in
                some other Unices.
    * pstree  - Shows currently running processes in a tree format.
    * pidof   - Finds process id of running programs, similar to pgrep
                found in some other Unices.
