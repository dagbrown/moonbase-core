Flex is a fast lexical analyser generator. It is a tool for
generating programs that perform pattern-matching on text. There
are many applications for Flex, including writing compilers in
conjunction with GNU Bison. Flex is a free implementation of the
well known Lex program. It features a Lex compatibility mode, and
also provides several new features such as exclusive start conditions.
