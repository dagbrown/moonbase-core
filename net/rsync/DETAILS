rsync is a replacement for rcp (and scp) that has many more features.
It uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast method for
remote files into sync. It does this by sending just the differences
in the files across the link, without requiring that both sets of files
are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.

NOTE: rsync as of 2.6.0, now defaults to using ssh. openssh is now a
required depends of rsync.
