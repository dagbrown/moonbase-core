texinfo - Utilities to work with and produce manuals, ASCII text, and
on-line documentation from a single source file.
Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
produce both online information and printed output. Instead of writing
different documents for online presentation and another for printed
work, you need have only one document.
Texinfo can produce output in plain ASCII, HTML, its own hypertext
format called Info, and (using TeX) DVI format.
